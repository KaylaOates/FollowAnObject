# Follow An Object
Using the ELEGOO robot, follow any object within one foot in front of it. 

### Part A  
The robot searches for an object using the ultrasonic sensor and turns the entire robot indefinitely, or until an object is seen. Following it backwards or forwards and turning towards it when moved to the right or left. 

### Part B  
The robot searches for an object using the ultrasonic sensor and “servoScans” (uses the servo motor) to determine its position before turning the robot if not initially seen.
